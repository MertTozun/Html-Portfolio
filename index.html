    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am ready to use the comprehensive knowledge I have gained in the field
      of molecular biology and genetics and the solid analytical skills,
      problem-solving ability and rapid learning capacity I have gained with 6
      years of biotechnology and molecular biology experience as a valuable
      Solution Developer in the software world. I am someone who dedicates
      myself to continuous improvement and learning, and I want to carry this
      passion to software development with the experiences I have gained in the
      world of science so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for software development and my scientific background have led
      me to find creative solutions to technical problems. My desire to
      constantly learn and my curiosity for technology allow me to bring a new
      perspective to every project and keep up with developing trends. In this
      way, I am ready to adapt to the continuous learning environment that
      software development brings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I aim to make valuable contributions to projects with my ability to
      understand and solve complex technical problems through effective
      communication and cooperation within the team. I am eager to constantly
      improve myself, discover new technologies and apply this knowledge
      effectively in projects. I have a vision of combining what I have learned
      by bridging science and technology while adding a software development
      focus to my career. I desire to add value by producing creative solutions,
      supporting teamwork, and at every point where I meet technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I aim to create a positive impact on projects with effective communication
      and cooperation within the team, and with an approach that is always open
      to learning and development. Making a new start in the software world is
      an exciting step for me. In this journey, I aim to make valuable
